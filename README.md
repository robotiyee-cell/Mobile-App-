# 👗 Looks 4 Fun  
### AI-Powered Fashion Evaluation & Outfit Rating App  

**Platform:** iOS (TestFlight)  
**Category:** Fashion · Lifestyle · AI Assistant  

---
## 🎯 Purpose  
Practice project exploring how AI-assisted tools can accelerate mobile app creation while focusing on real user experience design.

---

## 🧠 Concept & Design  
**Looks 4 Fun** is an intelligent mobile application that helps users evaluate, rate, and analyze their outfits using AI-driven fashion insights.  

The project was **inspired by personal needs** for quick, data-driven fashion feedback.  
I used **Rork**, an AI-based tool for automated mobile app generation, and then **personally designed the user interface (UI)** and **user experience (UX)** to ensure an engaging, intuitive flow.  

Users can upload or take a photo, select a clothing category, and tap **“Evaluate My Outfit”** — the app instantly analyzes the look based on style, color harmony, and trend relevance.  
It can also identify which **brand or designer**  a specific outfit resembles, helping users make smarter wardrobe and shopping decisions.
